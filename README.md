# ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM-USING-HAND-GESTURE
Hi Everyone. We ourselves, SHARON VARGHESE and  VIJAYATITHYAN S have made an attendance system using hand gesture. We are from SRM University currenty pursuing Btech in Electronics and Communications Engineering.

THE OVERLAYOUT OF THE PROJECT IS ON CREATING A ATTENDANCE SYSTEM USING HANDS TO CAPTURE THE PHOTO AND FURTHER USING IT TO PREDICT THE NAME OF THE STUDENT AND PUTTING THE TIME AND DATE OF THE PHOTO WHEN IT WAS CAPTURED.

Hope you like it!!!
